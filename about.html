    <p><b><i>Hello everyone, I am  Nurul Jannah Bt Bidin.I am 22 years old.I am from Terengganu and currently live in Kuala Berang, Terengganu. 
     I'm in my second year as a  business marketing student at Uitm Kampus Kota Bharu.I enjoy eating and sleeping as a hobby, but I don't always do it since it's bad for my health. I enjoy
     scrolling through my phone all the time because I want to know about current issues that happened on that day, and I cannot miss it at all.
     When I have leisure time, I love watching movie as well. It's either an old or new movie,I'm still enjoyed it as long as it's not boring to watch. As i took marketing subject, 
     I'm excited for the future as well. It's because nowadays, the  job demand for my course are high. As I conducted some research on jobs linked to my course, I dream of being a marketing manager or sales manager.
    I conducted some research on jobs linked to my course, and I hope that I can secure the job that i want üë©‚Äçüéì</i></b></p>

    <p><b><i>Aside from that, I'll tell you a little bit about my family. I have six siblings and i'm the second youngest. I have one older brother, three older sisters and one younger brother. 
        As you can see at the hierarachy of my siblings, me and my younger brother kinda got that younger privilege from my siblings but we're not that typical 'gold digger'ü´Ç
        Actually, I'm an introvert person,but when I'm among my close buddies, I'll be loud.Usually,I'm not one to leave the house for no reason, but if my buddies invite me out, I'll gladly accept. 
        However, if it is cancelled, I am normal and not too quite or disturbed. I'd rather stay at home and do anything I want, as long as it's only at home.I also enjoy cooking. 
        Occasionally, I assist my mother in preparing side dishes for that day's meal.My mother likes to compliment my food because she thinks it's amazing but my idleness outweighs my talent.
         That is why, despite my passion of cooking, I cook less. Everyone has their own goal right? In the future, the first thing I want to do when I got my first salary is give to my mother as much as I can. I will do anything to my mother 
         since she's the only one I have right now beside my siblings who really help me a lot especially in financial of my studies. I also want to bring my mother to perform umrah with me If its willü§≤</i></b></p>
